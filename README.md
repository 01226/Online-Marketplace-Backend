Full-stack Online Marketplace Backend

This repository contains the backend code for a full-stack online marketplace. The backend is developed using Spring Boot, a Java-based framework, and it serves as the server-side component of the application.

The backend of this online marketplace includes the following features:

Product Catalog: Users can browse through a catalog of available products. Each product is associated with details such as name, description, price, and availability.

Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their shopping cart while browsing the catalog. The cart maintains the selected products, quantities, and total price.

User Authentication: The application incorporates user authentication functionality. Users can create an account, log in, and log out. This ensures secure access to user-specific features and data.

Checkout and Payment: Users can proceed to the checkout process to finalize their purchase. The backend integrates with the Stripe API to process credit card payments securely.

Security Features: To ensure the security of the application, the backend includes several security measures, including JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication, OAuth 2.0 for authorization, OpenID Connect for identity management, and SSL/TLS for secure communication.
